# ENAE691 - Satellite Design Introduction, Spring 2021
Welcome to the group project.

You really should only ever need to edit two files:
1. The source text: `Project_src/Design_Project.tex`. \
If you're unfamiliar with LaTeX, check out [this](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) reference.
2. The bibliography: `Project_src/References.bib`. \
It's in IEEE format right but can be changed if needed.

The currect pdf of the project is Project_src/Design_Project.pdf.
